# OpenLorem

WebExtension API client for Lorem Ipsum providers.

## TODO

- make beautiful icons/logo
- make beautiful UI
- add more providers
- add provider switching functionality

## Currently supported Lorem Ipsum providers

- [Bacon Ipsum](https://baconipsum.com/json-api/)

## Where do I get the extension?

It will be published on AMO after it gets icons, nicer UI and more providers.

For now you can clone it and [install](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox) it as temporary extension for [debugging](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Debugging) purposes in Firefox.

## Should I contribute?

Yes!

## How?

One way is to fork, make changes, commit and make pull request.

You have your own Lorem Ipsum API? Let me know and I will add it.
